# AI-Based-Fire-Detection
This project leverages AI-enhanced fire detection to repurpose existing CCTV infrastructure, improving fire safety through real-time detection and immediate alerting. Using advanced AI algorithms, the system analyzes RTSP video streams to identify fire patterns instantly. A user-friendly GUI allows for easy monitoring and management. The solution transforms traditional surveillance systems into proactive safety tools by triggering instant fire alerts and providing post-incident video analysis. It enables faster fire response times and enhances overall safety protocols. Historical data supports better fire management strategies and preparedness. By integrating AI with current infrastructure, the system increases utility without the need for new hardware. The project strengthens urban safety and showcases the power of smart surveillance in emergency response.![fire](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbf64074-3f51-4fad-924c-140136d4ab57)
